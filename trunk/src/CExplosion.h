/*!
<B>New style</B> (not so good) : makes the explosions as up-to-date as
possible : the flame rays always go further until they are
forced to stop. On each update the blocks where there are
some flames and where the flame rays stop BURN. So if the
explosion duration is too long, the explosion can burn a
wall, and the item under it afterwards.

<B>Original style</B> (Super Bomberman) : the flame sizes are
computed once when the explosion is created. These flames
can be shorter, but not longer than the computed flame sizes.
The blocks where the flame rays stop BURN once. On each update
the blocks where there are flames BURN. So unlike the new
style, the result does not depend on the explosion duration.
